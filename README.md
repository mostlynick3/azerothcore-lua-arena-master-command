Simple script that lets users access the battlemaster frame from anywhere by sending the battlemaster frame from the player GUID. 

Is set up to send the Arena Master frame by default, but this can be switched to any other battlemaster frame easily. 

It works by constructing the packet normally constructed by an arena master, but sending it directly from the player instead of an arena master creature.

The packet's values are set from level 80 Arena Master information sent by the Dalaran Arena Master.
